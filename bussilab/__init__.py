"""A package collecting a heterogeneous set of tools.

This package collects a number of tools that are useful enough
to be distributed but too small to deserve being published as
separate packages.
Source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/bussilab/py-bussilab).
Submodules are listed at the end of the current page.
Command-line tools are described at [this page](cli_documentation.html).
This is the documentation for version __version__.

# Install

This package is only compatible with Python >=3.6 (no compatibility with Python 2!).
The recommended way to install this package depends on how you prefer to manage your
python dependencies.

_pip_.
If you manage your dependencies with pip and install packages in your home, use:
```bash
pip install --user bussilab
# make sure the user installed packages can be imported, or add this to your python path
export PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'import site; print(site.USER_SITE)'):$PYTHONPATH"
# make sure the bussilab script is your execution the path, or add this to your shell path
export PATH="$(python -c 'import site; print(site.USER_BASE + "/bin")'):$PATH"
```
Required packages will be downloaded and installed automatically in your home.

_pip + venv_.
If you manage your dependencies with pip and work in a [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), use:
```bash
pip install bussilab
```
Required packages will be downloaded and installed automatically in the virtual
environment.

_conda_.
If you manage your dependencies with conda, use:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -c bussilab py-bussilab
```
Required packages will be downloaded and installed automatically in the active
conda environment.

_macports_.
If you manage your dependencies with macports you might prefer to install required packages
first. Since the list of requirements might change, it is recommended to use
the bussilab package itself to obtain the list of requirements.
You can do it as follows:
[^macports]
```bash
# install pip and setuptools first
sudo port install py_macports_pynd_-pip py_macports_pynd_-setuptools
# install a bare version of the package, without dependencies
pip-_macports_py_ install --user --no-deps bussilab
# make sure the user installed packages can be imported, or add this to your python path
export PYTHONPATH="$(python_macports_py_ -c 'import site; print(site.USER_SITE)'):$PYTHONPATH"
# make sure the bussilab script is your execution the path, or add this to your shell path
export PATH="$(python_macports_py_ -c 'import site; print(site.USER_BASE + "/bin")'):$PATH"
# install the dependencies
sudo port install $(bussilab required --macports --pyver _macports_pynd_)
```
Notice that the list of required packages might change. It is
thus recommended to run the commands above every time you update the bussilab
package.

[^macports]:
Notice that on macports the name of the python executable is `python_macports_py_`
and the name of the pip installer is `pip-_macports_py_`.
A different python version should work as well.

### Checking the installation

Once the package is installed you should be able to import the module from the python interpreter:[^pythonpath]
```python
import bussilab
# this command can be used to check if all dependencies are in place:
bussilab.import_submodules()
```

[^pythonpath]:
If you installed the package using the `--user` option, in order to be able to import
the package you will have to make sure that the directory returned by the command
`python -c 'import site; print(site.USER_SITE)'` is included in your python search path.
If not, you can add it to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`.

You should also have access to an executable script that can be used from the command line:[^path]
```bash
bussilab -h
# this command can be used to check if all dependencies are in place:
bussilab check --import
```

[^path]:
If you installed the package using the `--user` option, in order to be able to execute
the script you will have to make sure that the directory returned by the command
`python -c 'import site; print(site.USER_BASE + "/bin")'` is included in your `PATH`
environment variable. Alternatively, if the `bussilab` script is not in your
`PATH` you can run it as `python -m bussilab -h`.

### Setting autocompletion

In order to benefit from autocompletion for the executable script you should
install the [argcomplete](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete) package
(with pip, conda, or macports)
and add the following command to your `.bashrc` file:[^macports_auto]
```bash
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete bussilab)"
```

[^macports_auto]:
If you are using macports, the command would be
`eval "$(register-python-argcomplete-_macports_py_ bussilab)"`.

# Getting started

### Python

The `bussilab` module itself only contains some basic infrastructure.
Most of the features are implemented in the submodules listed at the end of
this page.
Submodules should be explicitly imported using, e.g.:
```python
from bussilab import wham
```
Check their documentation to see how to use them.

If you are using Python >=3.7, you can directly use the submodules
without importing them explicitly, e.g.:
```python
import bussilab as bl
bl.wham.wham()
```

### Examples

In the [examples](../examples) directory you can find a number of notebooks
that can be used as a source of inspiration.

### Command line

In addition, the `bussilab` script allows to access some functionality
directly from the command line, without entering python.
For instance, you can execute the wham subcommand typing
```bash
bussilab wham
```
Check their documentation in the [cli_documentation](cli_documentation.html) submodule.

# Advanced stuff

Notice that instructions below assume you are using pip.
If you use conda or macports you might have to adjust the commands.

### Install with no dependencies

You might want to ignore dependencies completely:
```bash
pip install --no-deps bussilab
```
If you proceed this way, you will still be able to import `bussilab` module and
to execute the `bussilab` script, but some of the submodules might not be importable.
The following command will report which submodules can be used then:
```bash
bussilab check --import
```
The result will depend on which of the required packages are already installed on
your system.

### Run without installing

You might want to use this module without installing it. Since the module is
written in pure python,[^pure_python] it can be used by just adding its path to `PYTHONPATH`
and the `bin` directory to `PATH`:
```bash
export PATH="/path/to/bussilab/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/bussilab:$PYTHONPATH"
```
This is convenient if you want to use the development version of this package.

[^pure_python]: This might change in the future.

### Running tests

You can run the tests using `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

All tests should succeed.

### Running jupyter examples from the command line

You can rerun all the jupyter examples from the command line:
```bash
cd examples
pip install jupyter jupyter_contrib_nbextensions matplotlib
./rerun.sh
```

### Rendering jupyter examples as html from the command line

You can render all the jupyter examples as html from the command line:
```bash
cd examples
pip install jupyter nbconvert
./render.sh
```

### Building documentation

You can build the documentation using `pdoc3`:
```bash
pip install pdoc3
pdoc3 -f --html -o doc/ bussilab
```

Documentation will be found in `doc/bussilab/index.html`.

### Static analysis of the code

Static types can be checked using `mypy`:
```bash
pip install mypy
mypy bussilab
```
This check should succeed.

Other static checks can be done with `pyflakes`:
```bash
pip install pyflakes
pyflakes bussilab
```
This check should succeed.

Correct code formatting can be checked using `pylint`:
```bash
pip install pylint
pylint -E bussilab
```
This check should succeed.
